I'm currently working on a "simple" level for movement testing. 
Turns out that making a somewhat nice looking scenery is quite hard, so there's a lot for me to learn and  improve, especially the background.

After that:
- Health system and traps that actually do stuff.
- Combat system (both melee and ranged).
- Sound.
- A main menu and some boring UI stuff
- A fully fledged out level with platforming challenges, enemies, and even a miniboss (maybe)
- The fog is coming
